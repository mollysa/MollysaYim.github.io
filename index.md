Hi, I'm Mollysa Yim, a Computer Science student at SNHU. This site showcases my growth, skills, and completed projects from my time in CS 499, Computer Science Capstone. It highlights my work in **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **databases** through enhanced project artifacts and professional reflection.


## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my degree program, I have grown from learning basic programming logic to designing complete applications that integrate front-end interfaces, database management, and algorithmic problem solving. I’ve learned to approach challenges with creativity, persistence, and a focus on user experience. This portfolio reflects that growth by showing how I’ve enhanced my past projects to demonstrate more advanced concepts and stronger technical understanding.

My goal is to pursue a career in software development where I can combine my problem-solving skills and creativity to build meaningful, user-centered technology solutions.

## Artifacts and Enhancements

In this portfolio, I’ve included several key artifacts that represent my development as a computer scientist:

- **Inventory Management App (Android)** – Enhanced for software design, UI improvement, and feature expansion.  
- **Inventory App Algorithmic Enhancement** – Focused on search, sort, and batch operation efficiency.  
- **Database Integration and SMS Notifications** – Added SQLite data persistence and dynamic user alerts.

Each artifact includes a narrative explaining the enhancement process, challenges faced, and how it connects to the program outcomes.

## Code Review

Before enhancing each artifact, I conducted a code review to analyze the structure, logic, and opportunities for improvement. This helped guide my enhancement plan and ensured that my modifications aligned with course outcomes.
